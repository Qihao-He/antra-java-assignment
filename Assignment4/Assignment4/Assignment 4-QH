15. Create a program including two threads – thread read and thread write.
Input file ->Thread read -> Calculate -> buffered area
Buffered area -> Thread write -> output file
Detailed description is in assignment4.txt file.
Sample input.txt file.
Attached files are input.txt and a more detailed description file.
/*

Your program will take two input parameters: input file and output file java XXX <input file name> <output file name>
 
A sample input file is attached with this e-mail. 
 
 
The file contains many lines that look like this.
 
1 + 1 ­ 2
 
Problem Format:
 
<number><space><operation><space><number><spaces><...>

<number> - all are integers
<operation>  - just + and -
Note: You don¹t have to write a complex and error-prone parser to read the input file. Assume the file has valid syntax specified above. The goal of this exercise is to test your knowledge of Java Threads.
 
Output:
 
Your output should be as follows
 
<problem> = <answer>
 
Example input file
1 + 1
2 + 2 ­ 2
 
Example output file
1 + 1 = 2
2 + 2 ­ 2 = 2
